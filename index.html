<p>HapFlow is a python application for visualising haplotypes present in sequencing data. It identifies variant profiles present and reads and creates an abstract visual representation of these profiles to make haplotypes easier to identify.</p>
HapFlow-viewer displays the created flow file on the canvas of the GUI. An orange 
rectangle within the blue rectangle represents the portion of the genome currently being
displayed. Underneath, an orange rectangle with vertical lines represents where the variants
are located within the displayed section of the genome, these lines are extended below and
spaced an equal distance apart in the area where the flows are viewed. Each flow consisting
of one or more reads is represented as one or more arrows overlapping each variant line that
the reads of the flow align to. Width of the arrow represents the number of reads within that
flow. Variants on the same read of a pair are joined by a solid line, variants on different reads
of a pair are joined by a dotted line. Arrows grouped at the top of the canvas represent the
most common variant, the second group of flows represents the second most common variant
and so on. The last group represents potential sequencing, alignment or variant calling errors
as they have sequence that has not been called as a variant. Information about the sequence of
each variant is represented underneath the flows. The canvas is scrollable and zoomable
allowing the user to easily navigate through whole genomes

  <b>HapFlow diagram of sequencing data from a urogenital tract infection in a
koala mapped to C. pecorum</b>. Flows containing only the dominant variant group at the top,
flows containing only the minor variant group in the second row while mixed flows switch
between top and middle. A flow containing an alignment or sequencing error can be seen at
site E. All reads with the most common variant at site A have the least common variant at site
B. Similarly all reads with the least common variant at site A, have the most common variant
at site B. This pattern is repeated at sites C and D.
